## 1. Introduction

The DeFi ecosystem is not for everyone, yet. Newcomers to cryptocurrency face significant barriers: pishing, scams, confusing terms, hiding opportunities, complex operational and UI/UX that are not beginner friendly. These barriers create a high cognitive load, blocking beginners from earning interest in DeFi. InvestorHub solves this by simplifying investment processes to one-click access, through a unified interface that connects multiple battle-tested well-known protocols. Furthermore, offers interactive tutorials for newcomers with IHUB token rewards, transparent fee management, and curating secure investment opportunities. No matter the chain, no matter the token you have, we seamlessly connect users to opportunities.

</br>

### 1.1. What is _InvestorHub_?

InvestorHub is an abstraction layer designed to simplify on-chain investing through all ecosystem's opportunities. Our vision is to be the go-to and intuitive platform for novice investors, offering a secure, engaging, and educational experience that builds confidence, which includes pure DeFi and TradFi investments. With a gamified learning journey, transparent cost management, CCIP enabled cross-chain connections, and the IHUB utility token, the InvestorHub acts as an Investment Aggregator Protocol, seamlessly connecting users to secure DeFi opportunities while reducing cognitive barriers and common pitfalls.

</br>

### 1.2. Why is it relevant?

Recent estimations suggests that there are at least 1,000 active blockchains, and new projects are born every week. Although it seems too many, Sergey Nazarov(Chainlink Co-founder) often says that "each bank will have their own solution". Which means, looking from a TradFi perspective, there will be 10,000 plus blockchains eventually. Chainlink will connect them all, but how we expect users to track the opportunities that each, public, private, hybrid blockchains will offer? **They will not, and they don't need to because InvestorHub will aggregates the best of them in only one place**.

**Liquidity fragmentation** is real, but it's time to look into it as an **opportunity** and not as a problem. It is time to **connect** them all and stop complaining about it. But that's not enough, for this "experiment" to become the standard, is necessary to incentivize and to teach some core principles like keys management, investment risks and optimization opportunities, and that's why InvestorHub focus on the complete experience.

<br/>

<div align="center">
<h3> InvestorHub not only provides its users with the ways to do it, but will teach how to do it safely. </h3>
</div>

<br/>

### 1.3. How does _InvestorHub_ works?

Leveraging Chainlink solutions, InvestorHub connects its users to investment opportunities in a simple and straightforward way. Following rigorous due diligence, InvestorHub offer curated investments to simplify users' access to wider variety of investment opportunities. Removing the complexity of accessing multiple interfaces, giving multiple approvals, or even bridging. Users not even need to posses the final asset they want to invest. InvestorHub accepts any dex-tradable token, bridge it, or only converts it into the final asset, and invest it in behalf of the user.

Multiple different steps, inherent risk to web3 interaction and costs are resumed to one single transaction triggering.

### 1.4. _InvestorHub_ Advantages

- Abstracts multi-step complexity to one single call;
- Connect users to investment in any CCIP enabled chain;
- UI/UX focused on non-native users;
- Educational website session to enable users to learn before taking risks.
- Powered by AI agents to quickly elucidate users doubts about each investment.

</br>

## 2. InvestorHub Protocol

### 2.1. The MVP

This MVP is based only on Uniswap integrations, which means that the swaps are performed through UniswapV3 and the investment options available are full-range UniswapV3 pools. It simulates the following scenarios:

- [x] The user has LINK, on **Avalanche**, and wants to invest in a LINK/USDC Uniswap pool:
   1. The user starts the transaction by providing the total amount of LINK he desires to invest;
   2. Half of the LINK is converted to USDC;
   3. The equal USD proportion of LINK and USDC is deposited into the pool;
   4. The user receives the NFT receipt.
- [x] The user has wETH, on **Avalanche**, and wants to invest in a LINK/USDC Uniswap Pool:
   1. The user starts the transaction by providing the total amount of wETH he desires to invest;
   2. Half of the wETH is converted to LINK;
   3. Half of the wETH is converted to USDC;
   4. The equal proportion of LINK and USDC is deposited into the pool.
- [x] The user has wBTC, on **Avalanche**, and wants to invest in a LINK/USDT Uniswap Pool on **Ethereum**:
   1. The user starts the transaction by providing the total amount of wBTC he desires to invest;
   2. The total amount of wBTC is converted into USDC;
   3. The USDC is bridged from **Avalanche** to **Ethereum**;
   4. Half of the USDC is swapped into LINK;
   5. Half of the USDC is swapped into USDT;
   6. The equal proportion of LINK and USDT is deposited into the pool on **Ethereum**.

</br>

### 2.2. Future Investment Available

A HUB for investors require a full range of options, attending all tastes and goals. The Uniswap options are a small part of what InvestorHub will provide for its users. Follows a complete list of options in our roadmap:

- **Yield**: Lending, Staking, Vaults, RWAs
- **Risk**: Options, Derivatives, Tranches
- **Liquidity**: LPing, AMMs, Bridge tokens
- **Speculation**: Indexes, Synthetic assets
- **Credit**: Tokenized debt, Peer lending, Bonds

## 3. Tools Used

### 3.1. Chainlink Automation - Chainlinkâ€™s hyper-reliable Automation network

The Chainlink Automation will automate IHUB token buybacks. To offer a simple and straightforward experience, the InvestorHub protocol will charge its fees on top of the token that will be invested. However, our token is a great part of our ecosystem, and the Chainlink Automation will be custom trigger based in a USD value threshold. Every time the total value of a fee token reach the threshold, the automation will be triggered to initiate a swap. Swapping whatever the fee token is, into IHUB tokens. The majority of tokens will enter a vesting period, while a small amount will be used to cost infra, periodical audits, bug bounties and the team.

</br>

### 3.2 Chainlink CCIP - Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol

Chainlink CCIP is the backbone of our architecture. It connects our users to cross-chain investments in a secure and reliable manner. Investments and withdraws will be executed through CCIP lanes, when a user desires, removing trust assumptions and security concerns. This means that every cross-chain transaction, no matter if it is a user investment or a IHUB management, will be performed through CCIP's lanes.

</br>

### 3.3 Chainlink CCT

The Chainlink CCT is the pattern used on the InvestorHub Token(IHUB). It will enable seamless cross-chain transfers allowing the protocol to scale without constraints.

</br>

### 3.4 Data Feeds

Data Feeds enables us to convert CCIP fees, in LINK, into USDC and properly deduct the value from users before processing cross-chain transfers. It is a core feature for InvestorHub's complexity abstraction.

</br>

### 3.5 Chainlink Functions

Chainlink Functions is mainly being used to process IHUB swaps by creating the swap payload off-chain and excluding on-chain manipulation. It enable us to collect all information off-chain, creates the swap payload and trigger the swap. The Functions set will alway be triggered by the custom upkeep Automation keeper. The Chainlink Functions will also be used to trigger cross-chain transfers of protocol fees on chains the IHUB token has no liquidity, making possible to scale without liquidity dependency.

## 10. Roadmap & Release Strategy

- **To be Released**

## 11. Gaps, Open Questions, and Risks

### 11.1 Gaps

- **Regulatory Compliance:** Limited detail on KYC/AML implementation and jurisdictional requirements.
- **Investment Risks:** Incipient mechanism to mitigate impermanent loss for users.
- **User Education:** No assurance users fully understand investment risks.
- **Technical Implementation:** Detailed architecture for daemon service, caching strategy, and error handling for TheGraph outages not defined.
- **Revenue Model:** Specific fee structure is only part of the income, other flows will be attached on V1.

### 11.2 Open Questions

- **Gas Fee Management:** How to handle insufficient reserved gas fees for offboarding due to price spikes?
- **TheGraph Reliability:** What if TheGraph experiences downtime? Should a secondary data source (e.g., CoinGecko, Space & Time) be integrated?
- **Investment Selection:** What criteria for whitelisting pools? Who decides on inclusion/exclusion?
- **IHUB Utility:** What specific premium features will IHUB unlock? How to ensure long-term value?
- **Regulatory Landscape:** Which jurisdictions for initial launch, and how to adapt to evolving DeFi regulations?

### 11.3 Risks

- **Market Risks:** Crypto volatility, impermanent loss, and competitive landscape.
- **Technical Risks:** TheGraph disruptions, smart contract vulnerabilities, scalability challenges, and cache synchronization issues.
- **Operational Risks:** Gas fee fluctuations, liquidity constraints, and customer support scaling.
- **Regulatory Risks:** Evolving regulations, potential token classification as a security, and DeFi product classification.
- **Business Risks:** High user acquisition costs, revenue shortfall, token adoption failure, and user retention challenges.

### 11.4 Risk Mitigation Strategies

- **Technical:** Redundancy for TheGraph, fallback data sources, smart contract audits, and stress testing on V1.
- **Operational:** Dynamic fee adjustments, reserve fund for gas anomalies, and tiered support system.
- **Regulatory:** Legal reviews, phased rollout, and conservative token design.
- **Business:** Diversified revenue streams, strategic partnerships, and focus on user education.

## 12. Custody Model

- InvestorHub will operate as a **non-custodial** platform, utilizing wallet integrations for user-managed assets, ensuring users **always** maintain control of their funds.

### 13. Our Thoughts

InvestorHub idea has born from SmartCon 2024 in Hong Kong. Following many panels, multiple different opinions, it became clear that the complete integration between TradFi and DeFi depends on great effort from both sides, but also, depends on tools that enable it.
Chainlink provides the infra, but there is lack of impact solutions focused on onboarding, on handling newcomers. That is what InvestorHub completely offers.
